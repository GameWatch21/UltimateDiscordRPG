# Welcome to UltimateDiscord RPG
This project created to bring rpg game on discord using discordjs

I know there is alot of RPG game already that is far advance than this one, that's why i want to compete them and make this code publicly

## How does the game work and it's features?
I'm planning to add everything on RPG game into discord such as
- Exploring
- Scavanging
- Pet
- Levels
- Prestige
- Dungeon
- PvP
- Market (user)
- Shop (system)
- Crates
- Inventory
- Consumables
- Perk
- Class
- Stats
- Various locations to travel
- Crafting (for scavanging)
- Raids
- Clan

I know it's really a big expectation, but i will try my best to fullfill all of this, it's been my dream to develop a game (for discord lol)

For how the game work, i think everyone know how it's going to be anyway


## Is it okay for me to copy the code?
It's completely fine, feel free to use it, since i'm not that good reorganize the code and make it easy to read, i will try my best it's copyable and easy to understand

I use `quick.db` for my RPG game, which will handle everything inside the game, yes it require manual work for every data to be inserted, but i dont really care since i have times in my hand
